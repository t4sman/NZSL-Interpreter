<h1>NZSL-Interpreter</h1>
This is a work-in-progress New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Interpreter. The goal of this project is to leverage modern technologies to create a functional and educational experience for users who are interested in learning NZSL.

<h2>Technologies </h2>
The application is primarily built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The backend is powered by Express, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. The model was trained in Python using keras, and tensorflow

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
A key feature of this application is the use of a machine learning model for sign language classification. This model is trained using Python, a powerful language widely used in the data science and machine learning community.

The model is trained on over 5000 examples of sign language sentences, providing it with a foundation for recognizing and interpreting NZSL.

<h2>Setup</h2>
To set up the application for local development, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. After cloning the repository, install the dependencies by running <code>npm install</code> in the project root directory. You can then start the application by running <code>npm start</code>.

<h2>Usage</h2>
The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to input signs they want to learn. The machine learning model then interprets these signs and provides the corresponding NZSL interpretation.
